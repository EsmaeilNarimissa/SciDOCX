The methodology consists of atomistic, moderately coarse- grained (mCG), and highly coarse- grained slip- spring (SLSP) simulations. At the mCG level, a few chemically bonded atoms are lumped into one coarse- grained bead. At this level, the chemical identity of the underlying atomistic system, and the interchain topological constraints (entanglements) are preserved. The mCG interaction potentials are derived by matching local structural distributions of the mCG model to those of the atomistic model through iterative Boltzmann inversion. For matching mCG and atomistic dynamics, the mCG time is scaled by a time scaling factor, which compensates for the lower monomeric friction coefficient of the mCG model than that of the atomistic one. At the SLSP level, multiple Kuhn segments of a polymer chain are represented by one coarse- grained bead. The very soft nonbonded interactions between beads do not prevent chain crossing and, hence, can not capture entanglements. The topological constraints are represented by slip- springs, restricting the lateral motion of polymer chains. A compensating pair potential is used in the SLSP model, to keep the static macromolecular properties unaltered upon the introduction of slip- springs. The static and kinetic parameters of the SLSP model are determined based on the lower level simulation models. Particularly, matching the orientational autocorrelation of the end- to- end vector, we determine the number of slip- springs and calibrate the timescale of the SLSP model. As the test case, the hierarchical methodology is applied to cis- 1,4- polybutadiene (cPB) at 413 K. Dynamical single- chain and linear viscoelastic properties of cPB melts are calculated for a broad range of molecular weights, ranging from unentangled to well- entangled chains.

However, at low or moderate degrees of coarse- graining (lumping a few atoms in a CG bead) the interactions remain strong enough to prevent chain crossing and to preserve entanglement constraints between polymer chains. So far, various moderately coarse- grained models, which stay close to the microscopic structure, have been proposed in the literature for different polymers through different coarse- graining procedures. Typical examples include the works by Tschöp et al. \\(^{1,8}\\) who introduced a systematic coarse- graining procedure and applied it to derive CG potentials for polycarbonates. They generated long atomistic chains, with a proper distribution of torsional angles, through Monte- Carlo (MC) simulations and mapped them onto a CG representation by replacing groups of atoms with CG beads. The effective bonded potentials (bond length, angle, torsion) of the CG chain were calculated from the Boltzmann inverse of the corresponding distributions. Finally, the nonbonded interactions between CG beads were adjusted to reproduce the correct density of the polymer.

From Figure 13 and Figure 18 it is apparent that even a direct mapping from atomistic to the soft, CG (SLSP) model is not yet feasible with the available computational resources; the scales are too far apart.

With a standard structural- based method (here iterative Boltzmann inversion), we can transfer the static properties of the united cis- 1,4- polybutadiene (cPB) to a moderately CG (mCG) model.

However, because the SLSP model serves at a high degree of coarse- graining, the nonbonded interactions are soft and do not prevent backbone crossing. Therefore, without additional SLSPs, the model would not be able to capture the correct entangled dynamics. Hence, we have two kinetic parameters to pass from the moderately CG model to the SLSP model. i) a timescale mapping, and ii) the number of entanglements, which are represented via SLSPs in the latter model. We find that the end- to- end vector correlation, \\(P(t)\\) , allows a good mapping of both parameters.
