The first successful models applied residual and convolutional architectures to preprocessed MSA summary statistics [26, 27, 19, 29, 30, 20, 31]. The MSA Transformer was the first to successfully apply transformers to a large corpus (26 million) of unprocessed MSAs in an unsupervised fashion [6], extending prior work on protein language models (PLMs) [9, 7, 50]. Contemporaneously, AlphaFold2 was developed to take MSAs as input to predict protein structures and is additionally trained with an unsupervised BERT- style masked MSA prediction objective [51]. The resulting model, along with its successor AlphaFold- Multimer, has been widely recognized as a revolution in protein structure prediction. Since then, protein structure prediction models that replace MSAs with embeddings from giant PLMs have emerged [21, 8, 52]. They show promise as an emerging technology, but they have so far failed to match the performance of MSA- based methods across the board, significantly underperforming AlphaFold2- based entrants on difficult targets at the most recent installment of CASP [53].", "context": "", "metadata": {"section": "2 Related work", "is_heading": false}}

We observe very little run- to- run variability. For assessment we use IDDT- \\(\\mathrm{C}\\alpha\\) [61], a commonly used accuracy measure for protein structure predictions. We found that on a validation set of 180 unseen CAMEO [62] proteins drawn over a three- month period IDDT- \\(\\mathrm{C}\\alpha\\) was 0.866; the maximum value was 0.881 and the minimum was 0.848, while the median was 0.868.

Multimodal language models jointly trained on English text and biological sequence data have already been used to identify protein- protein interactions [73], classify adverse reactions to drugs [74], and caption molecules [75]. The multimodal scientific language model Galactica was also trained on protein sequences [76]. More indirectly, protein data often appears as a component in benchmarks for multimodal training methods. It has recently been added to DABS, a multimodal benchmark for unsupervised learning techniques [77, 78], and has been used to study multimodal scaling laws in generative models [79] and test the capabilities of pretrained language models across modalities [80]. As models become increasingly data- hungry, we believe databases like OpenProteinSet will be valuable on both of these fronts, as reservoirs of biological knowledge for generalist multimodal language models and also as tools for the empirical study of multimodal training per se.", "context": "", "metadata": {"section": "", "is_heading": false}}
