Dephasing is the loss of phase coherence due to the interaction of an electron with the environment.
The most common approach to model dephasing in light-matter interaction is the relaxation time
approximation. Surprisingly, its use in intense laser physics results in a pronounced failure, because
ionization is highly overestimated. Here, this shortcoming is corrected by developing a strong field
model in which the many-body environment is represented by a heat bath. Our model reveals
that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, how-
ever only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body
physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus
facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond science.

Introduction

Strong laser-matter interaction is commonly modeled as
a closed quantum system with a single active electron
[1, 2]. While this assumption is well justified for atomic
gases, its validity is not so clear for denser materials, such
as liquids and solids. A full many-body treatment of the
non-perturbative dynamics of all electrons and nuclei is
prohibitively difficult. Therefore, it is more practical to
model dense materials as a single active electron within
an open quantum system, where many-body effects are
accounted for by interactions with the environment [3, 4].
Due to its simplicity, the environment in intense laser-
driven solids is mostly modeled in the relaxation time
approximation [5, 6], where the effect of many-body dy-
namics is replaced by a dephasing time T2 [7–9]. Dephas-
ing represents the destruction of the coherence between
different one-electron eigenstates of the material, as a re-
sult of many-body collisions.

However, a simple calculation for an under-resonantly
driven two-level system reveals questionable features of
the relaxation time approximation [10]. Throughout this
paper, we refer to ionization as the laser-induced excita-
tion of an electron from the valence |0⟩ to the conduction
|1⟩ band, as determined by conventional optical field ion-
ization theory [11]. In Fig. 1a the ionization dynamics
with dephasing described via the relaxation time approx-
imation (yellow) and without dephasing (blue) are com-
pared. It can be seen that the relaxation time approxi-
mation predicts nine orders of magnitude ionization en-
hancement at very moderate electric field strength. This
is clearly unphysical according to experimental measure-
ments. Though this overestimation of ionization may
be mitigated by introducing a time-dependent relaxation
time [12, 13], the underlying issue is still not resolved. We
term the ionization enhancement caused by dephasing as
dephasing ionization.

FIG. 1.
Illustration of under-resonantly driven, open two-
level/band systems. Panel a presents the two-level sys-
tem (band gap Eg = 3.51 eV) described by the relaxation
time approximation. On the right-hand side ionization with
(T2 = 8 fs, yellow curve) and without dephasing (T2 = ∞,
blue curve) is compared. A moderate electric field strength
E0 = 5×108V/m with photon energy ∼ 0.39 eV (λ0 = 3.2µm)
is chosen. See Supplement Fig.S3 for details. Panel b shows
the two-band system coupled to a heat bath described via
the spin-boson model. The heat bath is modeled using boson
harmonic oscillator modes. As the temperature rises, boson
modes with higher energies are engaged (gray curves).

In short, dephasing ionization happens when the phase
relation between the laser and the two-level system is
disturbed. Therefore, the laser-driven virtual population
of the excited state is transformed into real excitation
i.e. dephasing ionization. Here, the virtual excitation
refers to the population that disappears after the laser
pulse. The apparent shortcomings of the relaxation time
approximation leave a gap between more complex and

computationally demanding many-body approaches and
oversimplified dephasing models commonly used in in-
tense light-matter interaction.

Furthermore, ionization is the first step in all strong
field processes, such as material machining [14–16], peta-
hertz electronics [17, 18], electron acceleration from nano
emitters [19], and attosecond spectroscopy in atoms,
molecules and solids [2, 20]. Due to the importance of
ionization, a deeper understanding of dephasing ioniza-
tion is essential.

As such, a more sophisticated model is needed that
ideally maintains most of the simplicity and wide appli-
cability of the relaxation time approximation. We borrow
inspiration from the field of open quantum systems and
adopt one of its key achievements, the spin-boson model,
which typically serves as a minimal model to describe the
quantum dynamics of an electron under the influence of
the environment [21–23]. Here, the spin-boson model is
integrated into the semiconductor Bloch equations gov-
erning intense laser solid-state physics. The electron dy-
namics is represented by a single electron-hole, two-band
model which is linearly coupled to its environment via
bosonic harmonic oscillator modes, see Fig. 1b. The so-
called strong field spin-boson (SFSB) model allows for a
closed-form solution of the electron dynamics in an en-
vironment and in the presence of an intense laser. We
refer to the environment as a heat bath in the rest of the
paper.

The SFSB fixes the pathological ionization behavior
displayed by the relaxation time approximation. Never-
theless, numerical analysis of the SFSB equation reveals
that ionization enhancement of up to a few orders of mag-
nitude is still possible, but only at high temperatures.
Interestingly, in the opposite low-temperature limit the
heat bath can suppress ionization by up to a few orders of
magnitude, which we term as dephasing suppressed ion-
ization. This occurs when the electron and heat bath
interact strongly.

The SFSB model provides a distinctive approach to
uncovering the physics of complex many-body systems
with minimal computational and mathematical complex-
ity. The predictive power of the SFSB approach can be
progressively refined through either more detailed models
or by fine-tuning the heat bath response through com-
parison with experiments. We anticipate that the SFSB
framework will facilitate the discovery of new phenomena
in strong-field physics and attosecond science.

Our analysis starts with a single electron two-band sys-
tem coupled to a bosonic heat bath via a linear interac-

Here, E(t) is the laser electric field, the vector poten-
tial is defined by −∂tA = E, and Kt = K + eA(t)/ℏ.
The canonical momentum K belongs to the shifted Bril-
louin zone BZ. Further, Ω(Kt, t) = (2e/ℏ)d(Kt, t)E(t)
is a generalized Rabi frequency, e > 0 is the elemen-
tary charge and ℏ is the Planck constant; d(Kt, t) and
E(Kt, t) represent transition dipole and bandgap between
conduction |1⟩ and valence |0⟩ band, respectively. The
time dependence of these quantities arises from the mov-
ing momentum frame. The Pauli matrices are denoted
by σj (j = x, y, z). Finally, ωq, ˆb†
q, ˆbq, and gq are the
harmonic oscillator frequency, creation, and annihilation
operators, and the coupling coefficient of a mode with
momentum q, respectively.

The coupling term between the heat bath and the two-
band system appears exclusively in the diagonal terms of
the Hamiltonian. Thus, it accounts only for dephasing,
and not directly for heat-bath driven transitions between
bands, i.e the off-diagonal terms. Nevertheless, due to the
coupling of laser and heat bath driven dynamics [5, 26],

high-temperature limit, multi-boson transitions between
valence and conduction band could become relevant but
are ignored here.

The Hamiltonian shown in Eq.(1) can be further sim-
plified. First, we perform a polaron transformation that
diagonalizes the laser-free Hamiltonian [27]. This is fol-
lowed by a change to the interaction picture, which re-
sults in

closed-form solution is obtained by using a Dyson expan-
sion up to the second order. As we are only interested
in the two-band system dynamics, the heat bath degrees
of freedom are traced out (see Supplementary Material
Sections II-III for details) [8, 24, 25, 28–35]. We found

that the dominant contribution to ionization is contained
in the second order expansion term [33] from which the

T dependence in Eq.(5) is contained only in the coth
term. The gq related terms in Eqs. (1,2) are replaced
by a spectral density J(ω) through a transition from dis-
crete to continuous modes. The spectral density depends
on two parameters: coupling strength jo, and cutoff fre-
quency ωc. There exists a wealth of different models for
the spectral density J(ω), such as the Debye [32], Ohmic
[8], Under-Damped Brownian [25, 34], Gaussian [35], and
Shifted-Gaussian models, the definition of which can be
found in the Supplementary Material, Sec. IV.

The relaxation time approximation is recovered for the
Debye bath in the high T -limit, C(t1−t2) → −(t1−t2)/T2
with T2 = ℏ/(2πkBT jo), as outlined in the Supplemen-
tary Material, Section IV.A. By contrast, the high T -
limits of the other heat bath models do not exhibit a
linear time dependence in the exponent.

In the context of strong laser solid interaction, the tem-
perature T refers to the local electron or ion temperature.
Our approach presents an approximation, as the system,
its dependence on laser pulse duration, is not always in
thermal equilibrium. This can be analyzed via the well-
established two-temperature model, where electrons are
first heated by the laser, and then the energy is trans-
ferred to the lattice, raising its temperature. Material
damage or melting is typically determined by the lat-
tice temperature. For dielectrics, damage occurs around
a few thousand K, even though the electron tempera-
ture can be much higher, reaching up to 105 K [38–40].
While our approach can be extended to describe non-
equilibrium heat baths, this would go beyond the limit
of an initial investigation.

The cutoff frequency ωc falls within the Terahertz to
the far-infrared range for phonons, and spans the far-
infrared to the mid-infrared range for collective electronic

3

excitations, such as excitons and plasmons. The cou-
pling strength jo is a dimensionless parameter ranging
from 10−3 to multiples of unity [24, 25, 41–44]. For
phonons, jo < 1 in III-V semiconductors, whereas jo > 1
in more polar II-VI compounds [3]. Strong electron-
phonon coupling jo > 1 typically occurs in very polar
materials [43, 45] such as bi-layer graphene [46], single-
layer InSe [47] and superconductors [48, 49]. For col-
lective electronic excitations, the coupling strength de-
pends on the electron density [50]. For electron densities
above 1020cm−3 and for ℏωc ∼ 1 eV the plasmon coupling
strength can become comparable to and even exceed the
phonon coupling strength.

Results

We have selected zinc oxide (ZnO), a representative
and widely studied semiconductor. The crystal momen-
tum k dependence in the entire 3D Brillouin zone is con-
sidered for the two-band system. Material parameters
are derived from ab initio calculations [51–53] (see Sup-
plementary Material Section V, Table I). We find that
both 3D and 1D calculations along the Γ-M direction
yield similar results in terms of relative heat bath in-
duced ionization changes, both quantitatively and quali-
tatively (see Supplementary Material Fig.S4). Therefore,
for computational efficiency, we focus on the 1D Brillouin
zone along the Γ-M direction throughout the following
calculations.

A driving laser with the center wavelength λ0 = 3.2 µm
is selected. The center frequency is defined as ω0 =
2πc/λ0 ≈ 2π × 1014 Hz (ℏω0 ∼ 0.39 eV) with c the
vacuum light velocity. The energy of the laser pho-
tons is much lower than the resonance energy of ZnO
(with a band gap of Eg = 3.51 eV), meaning that at
least 9 photons are required to excite an electron from
the valence band to the conduction band. We choose
a linearly polarized electric field defined as E = Ex =
E0 exp (cid:0)−t2/τ 2(cid:1) cos (ω0t), where τ = 20 fs. The electric
field strength E0 = 1.5 × 109 V/m is well below the single
pulse damage threshold of ZnO [54]. These parameter
values are used throughout the paper unless otherwise
stated.

The change of ionization due to the heat bath is charac-
terized by calculating the ionization ratio with and with-
out the heat bath,

where nc(t) is defined in Eq.(4).

In Fig.2a, the ionization ratio log10(η) is plotted ver-
sus T for Ohmic, Under-Damped Brownian, Gaussian,
and Shift-Gaussian spectral densities, all of which follow
a similar trend and yield comparable results. Thus, with-
out loss of generality, we have chosen the Ohmic spectral

converges to the relaxation time approximation at very
high temperatures. The temperature dependence of T2,
obtained from the Debye spectral density in the high T
limit above, is presented in Fig. 2c. Both Debye and re-
laxation time approximation show an unrealistic rise of η
at low T and therefore do not represent realistic heat bath
models. This is to be expected, due to the unphysically
long high-frequency tail of the Debye spectral density
[45, 55]. Finally, by comparing the zoomed-in sections of
Figs. 2a and b, one can see that the relaxation time ap-
proximation substantially overestimates ionization at low
temperatures, while all the other heat baths in a show
negligible changes in ionization, as detected by experi-
ments.

In Fig.3a, log10(η) is scanned over a wide range of T
and jo for three representative values of ωc, referring
to various collective lattice or electron excitations; (i)
ωc = 0.01ω0, (ii) ωc = 0.1ω0, and (iii) ωc = 2.1ω0. Acous-
tic and optical phonons span the range from (i) to (ii),
whereas collective electronic excitations span the range
from (ii) to (iii) with excitons for ZnO around (ii) [56]
and laser-excited plasmons in the spectral range around
(iii) and above [57, 58]. Although electrons are fermions,
their collective excitations can, to a good approximation,
be treated as bosons [25, 45, 50]. As such, they can be
directly modeled via the spin-boson Hamiltonian shown
in Eq.(1). While all T and ωc ranges can be realized in
intense laser-driven ZnO, the shown jo-dependence is not
ZnO specific. We explore the typical range of jo defined
above.

ature T for various heat baths. Panel b shows the ionization

ization. Figure 2b shows that the Debye spectral density

dephasing ionization. On the other hand, at moderate T
with strong coupling (jo > 1), ionization is suppressed by
multiple orders of magnitude, which we have termed de-
phasing suppressed ionization. These two limits are rep-
resented by data points nc1, nc2 in panel (iii) for which,
the temporal evolution of ionization is plotted in Fig.
3b. The black dotted curve represents ionization in the
absence of a heat bath nc(jo = 0).

The increase and decrease of ionization can be ex-
plained by the real and imaginary parts of the corre-
lation function C(t). With a given ωc, at extremely
high temperatures, the correlation function approaches
a delta function (instantaneous) in time, leading to the
Markovian limit [59]. In this limit, the real part of the
correlation function dominates, and one may neglect the
imaginary contribution. This is why the relaxation time
approximation using T2 as a purely real number remains
a valid approximation at high temperatures. On the

other hand, at low temperatures, the correlation func-
tion is non-Markovian with a wider distribution in time.
In this case, the phase of the correlation function acts as
a dynamic addition to the bandgap, increasing the origi-
nal material bandgap, and thereby resulting in dephasing
suppressed ionization. The importance of the heat bath
phase becomes clear from a comparison of 3b and 3c. In
Fig.3c the imaginary part of the C(t) is set to zero, as
a result of which ionization at T = 300 K changes from
suppression into enhancement.

To gain further insight into the parameter dependence,
ionization ratios are presented as a function of cutoff fre-
quency ωc in Fig.4a and of peak electric field strengths
E0 in Figs.4b,c. We have chosen two different tem-
peratures: 300 K (represented by the cold color dashed
curves) and 2 × 104 K (represented by the warm-colored
curves). The curves are color-coded to indicate different
coupling strengths jo, with the values of jo denoted in
the same color.

FIG. 4. Ionization ratio as a function of cutoff frequency ωc (panel a) and of peak electric field strength E0 (panels b,c) are
presented. We have chosen different values of jo ∈ {0.1, 1, 5} denoted by different colors beside each curve. The cold-colored
dashed curves are for T = 300K; warm-colored full curves refer to T = 2 × 104 K. In a, the ionization without the heat bath is
nc(jo = 0, t = ∞) = 2 × 10−6. Panels b,c are calculated by ωc = 0.4ω0. The relaxation time used in panel c is calculated by
T2 = ℏ/2πkBjoT . The pink curve plotted on the right y axis shows the ionization nc(jo = 0, t = ∞) in the absence of the heat
bath.

Figure 4a confirms that dephasing ionization only oc-
curs at high temperatures, while dephasing suppression
ionization happens exclusively at low temperatures. Fig-
ure 4b indicates that the heat bath only plays a role
at moderate electric field strengths. This can be ex-
plained by the multi-photon and tunneling ionization
channels. When the electric field is strong, the Keldysh
pm∗Eg/(eE0) where m∗ is the effec-
parameter γ = ω0
tive mass and Eg is the band gap energy, becomes smaller
than 1, suggesting the tunneling effects dominate [60].
With our choice of parameters, γ = 1 corresponds to
E0 ≈ 1.2 V/nm. Since tunneling (γ < 1) occurs much
more rapidly than multiphoton absorption [61, 62], the
heat bath cannot follow the ionization process and thus
has negligible influence at large E0. In addition, while
optical field ionization scales exponentially with E0, de-
phasing ionization scales proportional to the laser inten-
sity [10]. As a result, the relative importance of dephas-
ing ionization drops for increasing laser fields. The multi-
photon ionization (γ > 1) develops over an optical cycle

and thus is more sensitive to the non-Markovian heat
bath, making it more sensitive to heat bath influences.

In order to relate the relative ionization changes to
absolute values,
ionization in the absence of the heat
bath nc(jo = 0, t = ∞), is shown as a function of E0
in Fig.4c. At the highest field strength, ionization is
approaching saturation. Moreover, the ionization ratio
calculated via the relaxation time approximation is also
presented. Comparing Figs.4b,c, one can see that the
relaxation time approximation predicts orders of magni-
tude higher ionization compared to that predicted by our
model.

Discussion

So far, we have seen that the environment can modify
ionization by orders of magnitude in the extreme limits
of high T or strong coupling jo. The environment in in-
tense laser-solid interaction is difficult to control. There
are various ways in which the environment can be engi-

dephasing suppressed ionization.

First,

light modes in high-quality micro and nano-
cavities can be controlled to vary from sub-poissonian,
super-poissonian, poissonian, and squeezed vacuum to
thermal distributions; from weak to strong coupling with
electrons [63, 64]. As such, they can serve as an artificial,
strongly coupled environment in which the modification
of strong field processes by ionization can be investigated.
Second, collective electron oscillations can be created
in tailor-made experiments. The conduction band can
be populated by doping semiconductors, or with a pump
pulse in a pump-probe experiment.
Ionization changes
are probed with a second pulse or with transient ab-
sorption spectroscopy. As some of the effects observed
here depend on strong coupling with the environment,
control of the coupling strength is important. Coupling
strength increases when going from bulk to 2D and 3D
nano-scale materials, such as in nano-resonators and -
cavities [65, 66].

The possibility of engineering ionization has potential
practical impacts. First, dephasing ionization increases
ionization and thus, allows material micro-machining and
-modification at lower laser intensities. This could be
instrumental in generating highly charged ion states in
high-density plasmas with lower pump pulse energy, con-
tributing to the improvement of table-top X-ray sources.
Second, the transition between perturbative nonlinear
optics and strong field physics is marked by the onset of
ionization. Dephasing suppressed ionization shifts this
onset and permits probing dynamics in materials under
excitation conditions previously unattainable.

Conclusion

The relaxation time approximation is frequently used in
intense laser field physics to account for the many-body
coupling between a single electron and its environment,
which consists of lattice, impurities, and remaining elec-
trons. This work aimed to understand the failure of
the relaxation time approximation and to correctly de-
scribe ionization in an open quantum system. Ionization
in the presence of the relaxation time approximation is
enhanced by orders of magnitude over a wide range of
parameters, which is termed dephasing ionization.

To decide whether dephasing ionization holds physical
significance or is simply a failure of the relaxation time
approximation, we have developed a more comprehensive
model that captures more physics and still retains much
of the simplicity of the relaxation time approximation.

Our results confirmed that ionization enhancement
through dephasing ionization still persists, but only in
fairly extreme parameter ranges. Very little enhancement
is found for acoustical phonon frequencies. For optical
phonons and collective electronic excitations dephasing

6

ionization becomes dominant in the limit of high tem-
peratures. Our analysis has also revealed the possibility
that a heat bath can suppress ionization by orders of
magnitude, which we have named dephasing suppressed
ionization.

We presented a novel framework here to model in-
tense laser many-body processes in a low-cost, semi-
phenomenological way. Future research will entail find-
ing optimum heat baths and complementing the current
framework with more physics.
In addition, a simple
fermionic heat bath. Though the SFSB presents a good
approximation to a large class of collective excitations
of electrons and lattice, it does not account for electron-
electron scattering which requires an extended approach
with a fermionic heat bath [67]. Besides, heat bath pa-
rameters, such as material temperature, change during
intense laser interaction. As such, the ionization dynam-
ics investigated here present only approximate snapshots.
For a full treatment of laser material interaction, a dy-
namically evolving heat bath will have to be considered.
