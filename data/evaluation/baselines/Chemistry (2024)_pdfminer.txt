Abstract

Information extraction from chemistry literature is vital for constructing up-to-date

reaction databases for data-driven chemistry. Complete extraction requires combining

information across text, tables, and figures, whereas prior work has mainly investigated

extracting reactions from single modalities. In this paper, we present OpenChemIE to

address this complex challenge and enable the extraction of reaction data at the doc-

ument level. OpenChemIE approaches the problem in two steps: extracting relevant

information from individual modalities and then integrating the results to obtain a

final list of reactions. For the first step, we employ specialized neural models that each

address a specific task for chemistry information extraction, such as parsing molecules

or reactions from text or figures. We then integrate the information from these mod-

ules using chemistry-informed algorithms, allowing for the extraction of fine-grained

reaction data from reaction condition and substrate scope investigations. Our machine

learning models attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated individually, and

we meticulously annotate a challenging dataset of reaction schemes with R-groups to

evaluate our pipeline as a whole, achieving an F1 score of 69.5%. Additionally, the

reaction extraction results of OpenChemIE attain an accuracy score of 64.3% when

directly compared against the Reaxys chemical database. We provide OpenChemIE

freely to the public as an open-source package, as well as through a web interface.

Introduction

Reaction data curated from scientific literature is commonly used to train models for chem-

informatics. Today, this data is collected and maintained by experts in databases such as

Reaxys. 1 However, this manual extraction comes with prohibitive cost and delayed updates.

Moreover, increasingly nuanced machine learning models for reaction development require

more fine-grained and comprehensive data, pertaining to reaction conditions, substrate scope,

and other screening processes in synthetic chemistry. 2–5 Existing automated techniques can

only partially address this task, focusing on specific subproblems, such as reaction parsing

from individual diagrams or text passages. 6–9 In this paper, we present OpenChemIE, a

system that extracts reaction data from chemical literature at the document level.

This extraction task is difficult because large swathes of reaction data are realized in

multiple modalities, often requiring chemical reasoning to fully determine relevant molecular

structures. Figure 1 illustrates two challenges. First, the molecular structures are not entirely

depicted in the figure, as they contain R-groups. The abbreviated structures can be identified

by directly parsing phenol for R2 in entry 1 of the accompanying table, or by comparing the

differences in the molecular graphs of 1 and 1u in entry 21. Second, the system must

align additional reaction metadata with the correct structures. In Figure 1 the highlighted

tion template is displayed in a figure, but information regarding R-groups is only contained

molecule is only referred to by the label 1 in the footnote text, which contains detailed

reaction conditions. In other cases, conditions may also be defined in a figure or table, or

the reaction itself may be described in text.

which analyzes individual modalities and combines the extracted information together to

recover implicitly defined reactions. Building on our prior research in reaction extraction, 7

molecular optical recognition, 11 and reaction diagram parsing, 6 we design additional modules

that enable OpenChemIE to fuse information at three different levels. First, we train a

machine learning model to associate molecules depicted in diagrams with their text labels,

performing a multimodal coreference resolution. Second, OpenChemIE aligns reactions with

reaction conditions and other data presented in tables, annotated in figures, or discussed in

texts by utilizing the coreference information. Lastly, OpenChemIE recognizes R-groups in a

diagram by comparing molecules with the same label, and substitutes them with additional

substructures listed in substrate scope tables and figures, yielding complete substrate data.

We evaluate the performance of each individual machine learning module as well as

the system as a whole. To evaluate the overall performance of OpenChemIE, we manually

curated a dataset of 1007 reactions described in 78 substrate scope figures involving R-groups

across five different organic chemistry journals. The extraction task requires all reaction

components to be correctly predicted and R-groups to be resolved. OpenChemIE achieves

an F1 score of 69.5% on this dataset, and we performed a meticulous evaluation to analyze

the error contributions of the different modules of the pipeline, identifying areas where the

system could be further enhanced in future work. Furthermore, in an end-to-end evaluation

of OpenChemIE on extracting reaction data from journal articles, we attain an accuracy

of 64.3% when comparing against existing extractions in Reaxys. Notably, our models for

reaction diagram parsing, molecule detection, and coreference resolution all perform robustly

under evaluation on independent benchmarks, and our R-group resolution algorithm only

contributes to a small amount of mistakes. The majority of errors were due to mistakes in

molecule recognition or optical character recognition.

OpenChemIE is available on a public web portal (https://mit.openchemie.info) as

an easily accessible demonstration of key forms of analysis that we incorporate. The full

4

pipeline and its individual methods for analysis are provided in a Python package (https:

//github.com/CrystalEye42/OpenChemIE) that is suitable for larger-scale information ex-

traction. Our Python package allows for comprehensive extractions of molecules and reac-

tions from PDF files, as well as from only text and images. The toolkit is fully open-source

to facilitate future development in this area.

Related Work

Extracting From Figures This task includes molecule recognition and reaction extrac-

tion. Molecule recognition involves translating molecular images into SMILES strings. Initial

approaches employed rule-based methods for determining the structures of molecules, utiliz-

ing a suite of algorithms and heuristics to detect individual components such as bonds and

atoms. 12,13 Later works instead leveraged CNN-based encoder-decoder architectures from

deep learning to perform this segmentation, allowing for robust recognition across diverse

styles. 11,14–18 Recent research has also enabled the extraction of reaction schemes from fig-

ures, in which the reactants, products, conditions, and yield for each reaction are identified.

These works approached the segmentation either by using a series of heuristics and image

filters 19 or by applying data-driven models for object detection and sequence generation. 6,20

Several works have additionally developed systems for automatic extraction from figures

of real-world documents. These include ReactionDataExtractor 19 and its 2.0 version, 20 which

involve parsing reaction schemes, and also include MolMiner 21 and DECIMER.ai, 22 which

focus on molecule recognition. ChemSchematicResolver 8 is another molecule recognition

system that additionally resolves R-groups defined in text labels. However, achieving a

robust figure-based extraction system remains challenging due to the wide variation of styles

and possible complexities for molecules and reaction schemes.

Extracting From Text This task consists of identifying chemical entities and their roles,

as well as parsing described reactions. Several studies for the former have centered on dataset

curation. 23,24 For both chemical entity identification and reaction extraction, proposed solu-

tions include parsers that employ a series of regular expressions and classifiers to detect key

terms. 25,26 A deep-learning solution for extracting reactions instead formulates the problem

as a sequence labeling task and utilizes a fine-tuned transformer encoder architecture.

A few works have created systems that extract from PDF files of documents instead of

from plain text, presenting additional engineering challenges. These include ChemDataEx-

tractor 9 and PDFDataExtractor, 27 which identify chemical entities and their associated

properties. While these can extract important information available in text, they do not

process relevant information from figures that would augment the data. Text-based descrip-

tions of reactions and molecules are often underspecified, generally referring to these entities

using families of compounds or by labels defined in figures. Resolving these mentions to

obtain specific molecular structures is vital. In contrast to both these and the figure-based

extraction systems, OpenChemIE aims for a more versatile, unified system. The advantage

of OpenChemIE is our usage of specialized chemistry-informed algorithms to integrate ex-

tractions from multiple modalities, namely text, tables, and figures, thus overcoming the

single modality barrier and enabling more comprehensive extractions.

As seen in Figure 2, OpenChemIE addresses the task of extracting detailed chemical reactions

at the document level. We consider the input journal article to be a triple of (Figures, Texts,

Tables), which can be automatically segmented with existing PDF parsing tools. We seek

to extract the reactions described in the paper by identifying machine-readable structures

for their reactants and products, as well as other metadata. The expected output is a list of

reactions {R1, R2, . . . , Rn}, where each reaction Ri is a triple (Ri, Pi, Ci). Ri is the set of

reactants and Pi is the set of products, each consisting of one or more molecules expressed as

SMILES strings. Ci is the set of metadata associated with the reaction, including detailed

conditions and yield information, and may be empty if no such information is parsed from the

paper. We do not capture information contained in other plots, such as reaction coordinate

diagrams or spectral data.

The information extraction task is thus expressed as a function

f : (Figures, Texts, Tables) → {R1, R2, . . . , Rn}

(1)

Crucially, OpenChemIE establishes relationships between its three inputs to inform its out-

put, such that f (Figures, Text, Tables) contains more data than f (Figures) ∪ f (Texts) ∪

f (Tables), the result of individually extracting from each modality.

OpenChemIE Overview

In the following section, we present an overview of OpenChemIE, a dedicated toolkit designed

to extract full reaction data from chemistry papers. A summary of our system can be found

in Figure 3. Initially, OpenChemIE receives the document which has been segmented into

figures, text, and tables for use in the downstream steps of our pipeline (implementation

details are provided in the Supporting Information). For each modality, we have developed

through reaction condition alignment and R-group resolution in OpenChemIE to yield a
final list of reactions.

specialized machine learning models capable of effectively parsing molecules and reactions,

as well as inferring relationships between text and diagrams. To further expand the scope of

information captured by OpenChemIE, we implement two general procedures that fuse the

outputs of individual models to produce a more complete reaction list. A description of the

individual components of OpenChemIE follows.

• Figure Analysis. Analysis of chemistry figures requires strong visual understanding,

ranging from high-level comprehension of reaction schemes and relations between en-

tities to low-level recognition of molecules. To address this multifaceted challenge, we

provide four models for figure/scheme analysis. The first of these models is designed

for detecting sub-images of molecules within figures (molecule detection, MolDetect)

and providing the relevant bounding box. Another model is for resolving the coref-

erence between detected molecules in the figure and labels in the text (text-figure

coreference, MolCoref). Additionally, OpenChemIE utilizes our previous research for

• Text Analysis. Extracting from chemistry texts involves identifying mentions of

molecules and chemical reactions. To this end, we provide two models to address

both of these subtasks. The first one is a model for extracting chemical entities from

texts (named entity recognition, ChemNER). The second model, from our previous re-

search, identifies chemical reactions and their reaction conditions (reaction extraction,

ChemRxnExtractor). 7

• Multimodal Integration. We implement two additional procedures that integrate

information across our single modality models. R-group resolution is the process of

identifying and substituting R-group structures into reaction templates, which allows

for a more complete extraction of reactions. This process utilizes parsed data from

tables as well as molecule information from figure analysis models. Reaction condi-

tion alignment enhances text-based reaction descriptions with molecular structures

identified in relevant diagrams. These multimodal integration components enable

OpenChemIE to serve as an end-to-end pipeline for reaction extraction.

In the subsequent sections, we will elaborate on the technical details of each module

comprising OpenChemIE.

Figure Analysis

Figures in chemistry literature contain essential molecular structures and reactions, as well

as relational information to text in or surrounding the diagram.

In particular, the new

methods we develop focus on this latter aspect, which enable the success of our downstream

multimodal integration modules. As in Figure 4, OpenChemIE addresses four facets of figure

analysis, which we detail in this section.

9

Figure 4: OpenChemIE provides four models for analyzing figures in chemistry literature,
including molecule detection, text-figure coreference, reaction diagram parsing, and molecule
recognition.

Molecule Detection In chemistry literature, a single figure often contains multiple molecules.

The task of molecule detection is to segment the figure into sub-images of molecules such

that we can later recognize the structure of each individual molecule. Molecule detection

shares similarities with the extensively studied object detection task in computer vision, 28,29

which focuses on identifying sub-images of objects within natural photographs.

In OpenChemIE, we provide MolDetect, a molecule detection model formulated with

sequence generation. Inspired by the Pix2Seq 29 model designed for object detection, MolDe-

tect identifies molecular sub-images by predicting their bounding boxes as a sequence. Given

a figure, a molecule entity whose bounding box has top-left coordinates (x1, y1) and bottom-

right coordinates (x2, y2) is represented as five discrete tokens,

Molecule := x1 y1 x2 y2 [Mol]

(2)

where [Mol] is a special token indicating the detection of a molecule. MolDetect sequentially

MolDetectOutput := (Molecule)∗

(3)

where (·)∗ means zero or more occurrences.

MolDetect is implemented as an encoder-decoder architecture. The figure is encoded

using a convolutional neural network to obtain hidden representations. Then, the decoder

is a Transformer which generates the output sequence as defined in Equations (2) and (3).

Text-Figure Coreference It is common practice in chemistry literature to assign unique

identifiers to the molecules depicted in a figure and subsequently refer to them by their

respective identifiers in the accompanying text. To establish a clear link between the infor-

mation in the text and the figure, we have developed MolCoref, a model that pairs molecules

with their respective identifiers in the figure. An example prediction from MolCoref can be

found in Figure 5, which depicts the molecules and identifiers being successfully detected

and the corresponding links established.

MolCoref also employs a sequence generation approach to resolve the coreference between

identifiers and molecular structures. Specifically, its output format is defined as

MolCorefOutput := (Molecule [Identifier]?)∗

Molecule := x1 y1 x2 y2 [Mol]

Identifier := x1 y1 x2 y2 [Idt]

(4)

where [·]? means optional. Both the Molecule and Identifier are represented using five tokens,

consisting of four coordinates and a final token to differentiate them. When a Molecule is

paired with an Identifier in the figure, the model generates the Molecule first, followed by

the corresponding Identifier. Otherwise, the model generates only the Molecule without the

Identifier. Based on MolCoref’s output, we use a molecular recognition model to parse the

chemical structures and an optical character recognition (OCR) model to parse the text

strings.

Compared to the previous approach 8 that relies on heuristic rules for aligning molecules

with their identifiers, MolCoref integrates the detection of molecule bounding boxes and

the resolution of text-figure coreference into a single model. This simplifies the process and

mitigates the risk of error propagation. Furthermore, as our experiments will demonstrate,

our data-driven model yields more accurate and reliable predictions.

reactions in the figure. Then, the molecules and text are recognized by MolScribe and OCR
models respectively.

Reaction Diagram Parsing Reaction schemes are often defined graphically within figures

and in a wide range of styles, requiring a sophisticated level of visual understanding to

correctly extract. To this end, OpenChemIE incorporates RxnScribe, 6 a model previously

designed for the extraction of reaction schemes from figures. Figure 6 demonstrates the

extraction process on a figure with two reactions. In it, RxnScribe predicts the structure of

both reactions correctly, with reactants, conditions, and products highlighted in red, green,

and blue boxes, respectively.

Molecule Recognition Molecule recognition is the task of translating an image of a

molecule into its corresponding chemical structure, typically represented as a SMILES string

in a computer-readable format. OpenChemIE includes MolScribe, 11 a model we developed

earlier for molecule recognition. Our previous modules for text-figure coreference and re-

action diagram parsing only extract the high-level structure of diagrams. To fully extract

the reaction or molecular information, we further crop the bounding boxes and pass the

individual subdiagrams to downstream modules. As shown in Figure 5, we use MolScribe

are drawn from Liu et al.. 31

and EasyOCR, 30 an off-the-shelf optical character recognition tool, to translate the content

in each bounding box to paired SMILES strings and text labels. Similarly, in Figure 6, we

use the same tools to extract the molecular structures of products and reactants, as well as

text descriptions of accompanying reaction conditions.

Text Analysis

As seen in Figure 7, OpenChemIE contains two powerful natural language processing models

which excel at extracting chemical entities and reactions from the text in chemistry litera-

ture.able to extract chemical entities and reactions from text. The machine learning models

are named ChemNER and ChenRxnExtractor respectively.

Named Entity Recognition Our first model is dedicated to the task of extracting chem-

ical entities from a given text excerpt. In scientific literature, chemical entities can take on

diverse forms, including molecular formulas (e.g., NaOH), IUPAC systematic names (e.g.,

1,3,4-oxadiazole), abbreviations (e.g., GABA), or database identifiers (e.g., CID16020046).

For successful extraction, it is essential to locate these mentions in the text and accurately

determine their specific forms.

14

ChemRxnExtractorChemNERIn OpenChemIE, we provide a model named ChemNER, which is trained on the publicly

available CHEMDNER corpus. 23 This corpus comprises a collection of PubMed abstracts

with expert-annotated chemical entity mentions. Our model adopts a sequence tagging

approach using the BIO format. We fine-tune a language model that has been pre-trained

on biomedical literature, 32 further enhancing the model’s performance and domain-specific

understanding.

In Figure 7, ChemNER detects all three chemical entities and correctly

makes the distinction that “cyanamide” refers to a specific compound whereas the other

chemical mentions refer to general families of compounds.

Reaction Extraction Reaction extraction is a structured prediction task that involves

identifying the reactions presented in the text. OpenChemIE includes ChemRxnExtractor, 7

a model previously developed for text-based reaction extraction. Figure 7 displays a pro-

cessed reaction description where the product is represented by the identifier “4a”, with

additional information about reaction conditions and yield also highlighted. However, the

chemical structures of the extracted reactant “1a” and product “4a” are omitted in the text,

highlighting the importance of our models for coreference resolution and molecule recognition

in diagrams.

Multimodal Integration

Complete reaction schemes, which require full structural information of reactants and prod-

ucts as well as complex descriptions of reaction conditions, are often specified across multiple

paragraphs, tables, and figures. Understanding the connections between these modalities is

challenging, as demonstrated in Figure 1, and has not been significantly explored by previous

works. OpenChemIE begins to address the general task of multimodal integration by divid-

ing the problem into two main challenges. For one, detailed reaction condition and yield data

must be properly aligned with machine readable molecular structures of the reactions they

refer to. Furthermore, many diagrams are underspecified, and the R-groups they contain

15

Figure 8: Reaction Condition Alignment. We augment incomplete reaction descriptions in
text with resolved molecule identifier pairs and parse additional reaction condition tables.
Example adapted from Liu et al.. 31

must be inferred from a separate molecule in the diagram or a completely different table

altogether.

In the following sections, we describe how we integrate our individual model

results together for multimodal understanding.

Reaction Condition Alignment

In OpenChemIE, we provide methods to align the re-

action data contained in figures with the information from text and tables, obtaining more

complete reaction descriptions.

One type of reaction condition alignment we address is the task of integrating information

from condition screening tables with their corresponding reactions displayed in figures, such

as in Figure 8. For this, we created a parser to extract the table headers and columns. We

use a dictionary-based classifier to categorize each column based on its header, such as being

for temperature, solvent, yield, or other common types of metadata. Each row in the table

corresponds to a complete configuration of reaction conditions, which we add to the set of

reaction conditions for the relevant reaction.

then substituted into the appropriate reactant molecule templates. Example adapted from
Zhang et al. 33

Reactions and their details are often described within the accompanying text as well.

However, the reactants and products in this modality are often distinguished by their unique

identifier, with the structural information of the molecules defined separately in figures.

With only the identifier, these text-based reactions would be incomplete due to the missing

of molecular structures. To address this issue, we align the molecular structure information

from figures with their identifiers in text. From our figure analysis module, we first obtain a

mapping between the identifiers and their structures using MolCoref. Whenever an identifier

is encountered during the text-based reaction extraction stage, we substitute the identifiers

with their SMILES representation. This integration along with our table-figure integration

allows for the unification of information across three modalities to extract significantly more

complete reaction data.

R-Group Resolution Previous work from ChemSchematicResolver 8 has been done to

parse simple definitions of R-groups that are explicitly expressed as text chemical formulae

within figures (e.g., “R=Me”) and perform the corresponding substitutions. In addition to

this case, OpenChemIE seeks to comprehend other forms of substrate scope, namely the

17

Expanded Reaction ListReactantsProductsreactantsproduct…productreactantsFrom diagrams:From tables:Me =tBu =Ar =R-group substitutionR-group identiﬁcationcases where products are depicted as different molecular structures or where a table separate

from the reaction scheme defines the R-groups, which require further reasoning to determine

the resolved molecular structures.

We address the two most common modes of presentation for substrate scope, which are

shown in Figure 9. In the first case, the reaction template is displayed graphically and the

R-groups are defined as text in an associated table or label. For this, we parse the R-group

information from the text formula and use MolScribe 11 to predict the graph structures of

the template molecules. We then directly substitute the chemical formulas of the R-groups

into their placeholders in the graphs. These structures are then expanded and converted to

SMILES strings by MolScribe’s postprocessing methods.

In the second case, in addition to a reaction template, there is a set of possible products

defined in the diagram with which one must infer the structures of the R-groups and the re-

actants. To approach this, we first leverage MolCoref to identify the labels of all molecules in

the figure and match the label prefixes to associate the specific products with their template

molecule. Given the reaction template and the specific product, we use a subgraph isomor-

phism algorithm implemented in RDKit 34 to identify the atom mapping between the two

molecular structures. The unmapped atoms in the specific product are molecular fragments

that correspond to the substructures of the R-groups. We substitute the identified R-group

fragments into the reactant templates in order to obtain the full molecular structures of the

entire reaction.

With the two integration steps presented above, we obtain a reaction list with complete

molecule structures and conditions. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of the

pipeline.

18

Experiments

One of the central challenges in developing a reaction extractor is a lack of high-quality

benchmark datasets with corresponding evaluation metrics. To this end, we created our

own dataset consisting of reactions and diagrams from chemistry literature, with manually

produced annotations. In addition, we compared the system output against reactions in the

Reaxys database. While our annotation scheme and extraction scope are not fully aligned

with that of Reaxys (e.g., Reaxys does not include reactions with low or no yield), this

challenging evaluation provides another measure of the system performance. We conduct a

meticulous error analysis for both evaluation settings and further discuss the performance

of individual modules in OpenChemIE.

Evaluation With Annotated Data We evaluate OpenChemIE on a newly annotated

reaction extraction dataset. This dataset contains 1007 reactions collected from 78 figures

from recent issues of five chemistry journals: Journal of Organic Chemistry, Organic Letters,

Angewandte Chemie International Edition, European Journal of Organic Chemistry, and

Asian Journal of Organic Chemistry. The figures in this dataset are substrate scope diagrams.

Using ChemDraw, we annotated SMILES strings for every reaction by inferring the structure

of reactants from the structures of the template product and table of full products. A set

of example annotations for this dataset is displayed in Figure 10. For each substrate scope

diagram, we first annotate the reaction template (R, P ), where R and P are the sets of

SMILES strings for the reactants and products respectively, which may contain R-groups.

Then, we annotate the substrate scope {(Ri, Pi)}, where Ri is a set of reactants whose

R-groups have been substituted based on Pi.

For this dataset, we evaluate the model’s predictions using exact match, i.e., a predicted

reaction ( ˆR, ˆP ) is considered correct only if all the molecular structures of its reactants and

products match those in a ground truth reaction. We compute the precision, recall, and F1 to

assess the model’s performance. Here, the precision measures what fraction of the model’s

predictions is correct, the recall measures what fraction of the ground truth reactions is

correctly predicted, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. As seen in

Table 1, OpenChemIE achieves a precision of 79.1%, recall of 62.0% and F1 score of 69.5 %

on this task.

Each individual module in OpenChemIE is also evaluated on an independent benchmark

to measure its performance in isolation of the entire system. Table 1 shows state-of-the-art

performances of all six individual machine learning models on their respective benchmarks.

In particular, MolCoref achieves an 90.1% F1 score on a dataset of 1696 diagrams metic-

ulously annotated with molecule-identifier information. As detailed in our past research,

RxnScribe achieves a strong 91.0% F1 score on identifying single line reaction diagrams, and

MolScribe has an accuracy of 71.9% on realistic molecular structures drawn from past ACS

publications. We discuss additional evaluation details and error contribution rates to the

next section.

Evaluation With Reaxys We evaluate the performance of OpenChemIE by comparing

the extractions against those in Reaxys. Reaxys is a large commercial database of reactions

that is periodically updated by chemical experts who manually extract the data from journal

articles.

We construct the dataset for this task by collecting 19 journal articles containing 155

figures from recent issues of The Journal of Organic Chemistry and Organic Letters that

contained reaction condition and substrate scope screening tables. These journal articles

were each converted into a triple of figures, texts, and tables for input to OpenChemIE

with a set of off-the-shelf PDF-parsing tools corresponding to each modality. 27,36,37 Due

to errors in diagram parsing frequently yielding inaccurate borders, we manually adjusted

diagram segmentations for this dataset. Existing reaction extractions in Reaxys provided the

groundtruth annotations. For each article, the groundtruth thus contains a list {(Ri, Pi)}

where Ri and Pi are sets of SMILES strings for the reactants and products respectively.

We use a soft match to evaluate the accuracy of our pipeline’s predictions. First, molecu-

lar structures are considered to be equivalent if they are tautomers to each other since some

compounds rearrange to specific isomers in solution. Second, a predicted reaction ( ˆR, ˆP ) is

considered correct if Reaxys contains an entry (R, P ) such that ˆR is a subset of R and ˆP is a

21

subset of P . We choose to use this evaluation metric because of ambiguities that arise during

the annotation process, for example, whether certain compounds are considered reactants or

reagents specified in the set of conditions instead.

As seen in table 2 OpenChemIE extracts 400 reactions from this dataset, of which 257

have a soft match in the Reaxys database, for an accuracy of 64.3%. Since ReactionDataEx-

tractor 2.0 20 does not extract from texts or tables, we only provide the segmented diagrams

for each journal article to ReactionDataExtractor 2.0. It achieves an accuracy of 8.8% with

102 total predictions in this evaluation setting. Besides reactions described in texts or ta-

bles, ReactionDataExtractor was also unable to resolve reactions whose depictions involved

R-groups, which comprised the majority of reactions extracted by OpenChemIE. Moreover,

we applied the same evaluation to the fully automatic version of OpenChemIE provided

through our code package and web portal. In this setting, OpenChemIE achieved an accu-

racy of 46.0% on 359 total predictions. The decrease in accuracy can mainly be attributed to

inaccurate diagram segmentations during the PDF parsing process, since the automatic tool

LayoutParser was not trained specifically on chemistry literature. Additional implementa-

tion details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Analysis and Discussion We analyze the error contribution of individual components

in OpenChemIE. Since the majority of reactions extracted in the previous evaluations are

described in substrate scope diagrams, we focus our analysis towards the performance on the

task of extracting from this setting. Figure 11 displays the error contribution of each module

in the R-group resolution process. The full evaluation scores of each model are displayed in

Table 1.

Figure 12 illustrates examples of successful predictions and common errors by OpenChemIE.

In Example (1), OpenChemIE is able to correctly identify the reaction template, determine

the molecular bounding boxes, and resolve all of the coreferences correctly. The overall

pipeline is able to extract all four reactions depicted in the substrate scope diagram cor-

rectly, which can be attributed to the strong performance of MolCoref and RxnScribe in the

initial stage. We provide evaluation results of MolDetect and MolCoref in Table 3 and also

compare the models against ChemSchematicResolver. 8 MolDetect and MolCoref leverage the

simple sequential learning framework to achieve strong performance in both tasks, whereas

errors propagate throughout ChemSchematicResolver’s rule-based pipeline. Per Figure 11,

MolCoref ultimately caused 15% of incorrect predictions. This outsized error contribution

was primarily due to diagrams in which one molecule had multiple labels, a presentation

style not seen in the training dataset. On the other hand, RxnScribe achieves an F1 score

of 91% for parsing single line reaction diagrams, which make up the majority of reaction

templates in substrate scope diagrams, and contributed to 0% of overall errors. Our prior

work 6 provides a more detailed quantitative evaluation of RxnScribe on extracting reactions

from diagrams of various styles.

Our R-group resolution algorithm also performs robustly and is generally able to correctly

identify the R-groups from each product and perform the corresponding substitutions in the

reactant template when the input is free of errors. However, there were a small number

of cases where the algorithm returned an incorrect prediction. For example, some product

templates are completely symmetric but contain two different R-groups. Since the R-group

resolution algorithm does not take into account information about the layout or color of the

original diagram, it is unable to differentiate between the two correctly extracted R-group

fragments. In other diagrams where errors occurred, specific presentation choices violated

assumptions made in the design of the algorithm. Some authors switched the chirality of

certain atoms between the template and product, and others included products where not

every R-group in the original template had a substituent. A more detailed discussion of

specific errors can be found in the Supporting Information.

In contrast, over half of the errors in the OpenChemIE pipeline occurred during molecule

recognition. In Figure 12, example (2) displays a MolScribe error occurring on a MolCoref

prediction, where a molecule with label 3u is parsed incorrectly. Example (3) displays an

instance where there is a MolScribe error in the original reaction template. From this, we

observe that there are two reasons for MolScribe’s outsized error contribution. First, if there

is a single MolScribe error in the original reaction template, the extraction results for the

entire diagram will be incorrect. This scenario contributed 41.6% of all errors. Second,

MolScribe only achieves a 71.9% accuracy on molecules from ACS publications, which are

often drawn in diverse styles. 11 Furthermore, the tool we employed for optical character

recognition of molecule labels, EasyOCR, was another large source of error. Many labels

were parsed incorrectly.

In example (2), the label “3g” was mistakenly parsed as “39”,

which meant that the product was not processed by the downstream algorithm, as it was

not associated with the product with label “3”.

We further analyze the two text-based extraction models in OpenChemIE, namely Chem-

NER and ChemRxnExtractor. ChemNER is trained based on the BioBERT-large 32 check-

point using the CHEMDNER dataset. 23 The dataset annotates mentions of chemical entities

in seven types. Whereas past work does not make distinctions based on entity type during

the evaluation, we evaluate the entity-level precision, recall and F1 scores on each type and

also report the micro-averaged overall performance in Table 4. The model achieves an F1

score of 87.57 % on the entire test set, with stronger performance on the two most common

classes, SYSTEMATIC and TRIVIAL. Complete evaluation results for ChemRxnExtractor

can be found in previous work. 7

OpenChemIE Interfaces

OpenChemIE is accessible through two interfaces: (1) a comprehensive Python package

that integrates all our models and utility functions, and (2) a user-friendly Web portal that

simplifies the toolkit’s usage, making it accessible to a wider audience, even those without

programming knowledge.

Python Package We provide an open-source Python package (https://github.com/

CrystalEye42/OpenChemIE) that integrates all our models and utility functions, including

26

the PDF parser and the models for text, figure, and table analysis. We further implement

methods that take a PDF document as input and effortlessly execute the information ex-

traction pipeline, returning the extracted molecule and reaction data in a structured format.

To ensure smooth usage, we provide detailed installation instructions and example use cases,

enabling chemists with basic programming skills to efficiently process literature data using

the toolkit.

Web Portal We have developed a user-friendly web portal (https://mit.openchemie.

info) that streamlines the PDF upload process, automatically executes extraction models,

and conveniently displays the results. Users can upload a PDF document of a chemistry

paper, which will be processed on our backend server using the OpenChemIE toolkit. The

extraction results will be visualized on the portal. As in Figure 13, predicted molecule

structures are displayed in a web-based Ketcher editor, enabling the user to edit the model’s

predictions if desired. Due to computational constraints, our public portal can process a

maximum of five pages from each paper. However, users can freely download and deploy the

web portal on their own machines, granting access to all functionalities.

Conclusion

In this paper we present OpenChemIE, a comprehensive system for information extraction

from chemistry literature at the document level. OpenChemIE addresses the need for the in-

tegration of information across multiple modalities in order to provide complete extractions

of molecules and reactions. We approach the general challenge of chemistry information

extraction by incorporating chemistry-informed algorithms to integrate the results from in-

dividual modalities to obtain the final outputs. This approach allows for the extraction of

previously unresolvable information, such as substrate scope investigations, and is a notable

step toward achieving multimodal analysis of chemistry literature.

OpenChemIE has made remarkable progress toward its objective of extracting reaction

files. The uploaded PDF document is from Wu et al.. 38

data comprehensively from chemical literature, although some challenges remain to be ad-

dressed. For instance, there is room for enhancing the performance of machine learning

models on diverse literature data: MolScribe might be further developed to more precisely

capture less common representations of molecular structures, including Markush structures;

the PDF parsing tool may benefit from adjustments to better cater to chemical documents.

Additionally, while our system is adept at parsing multiple multimodal relationships, en-

hancing its ability to understand the complex interdependencies between different modalities

in chemical documents represents an exciting area for future development. The emergent

abilities of large language models hold promise for providing a more integrated end-to-end

solution for chemical information extraction, suggesting an optimistic pathway forward.
